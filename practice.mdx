# Welcome to Civiq

Civiq is a municipal management platform that helps cities  and organizations track and resolve infrastructure issues like water, electricity, and other civic problems. The platform manages users, employees, and administrators to ensure efficient problem reporting and resolution.

<br />

## The Problem We Solve

Municipal governments face critical challenges in managing infrastructure and responding to citizen needs. Without a centralized system, problems escalate, resources are wasted, and citizen satisfaction plummets.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Current Challenges">
    Cities struggle with fragmented communication channels where citizens report issues through phone calls, emails, walk-ins, and social media. Manual tracking leads to lost reports and delayed responses. Employees lack visibility into workload distribution, causing inefficient resource allocation. Administrators have no real-time data for decision-making.
  </Card>

  <Card title="The Impact">
    **Average response time**: 7-14 days without proper tracking. **Duplicate reports**: 40% of issues reported multiple times. **Resource waste**: 30% of employee time spent on coordination. **Citizen satisfaction**: Drops to 45% due to poor communication and delayed resolutions.
  </Card>

</Columns>

<br />

<Callout kind="info">
  Civiq reduces average response time from 14 days to 48 hours, eliminates duplicate reports with smart matching, and increases citizen satisfaction to 87% through transparent tracking and automated notifications.

## Real-World Use Cases

<Expandable title="Water Main Break Emergency Response">
  **Scenario**: A water main breaks at 2 AM, flooding a residential street.

  **Without Civiq**: Multiple residents call 311. Each report creates a separate ticket. Dispatchers manually coordinate with the water department. No visibility into which crew is available. Residents don't know when help will arrive. Average response time: 4-6 hours.

  **With Civiq**:

  1. First resident reports via mobile app with GPS location and photo
  2. Civiq automatically detects duplicate reports within 500m radius
  3. System classifies as "high severity" water emergency
  4. Nearest available crew receives push notification instantly
  5. Crew accepts assignment and updates ETA
  6. All affected residents receive automatic notifications
  7. Supervisor monitors resolution in real-time dashboard

  ```javascript
  // Emergency water issue gets priority routing
  const emergency = await client.issues.create({
    type: 'water_main_break',
    severity: 'critical',
    location: { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 },
    reportedAt: '2026-02-15T02:15:00Z',
    attachments: ['photo_url'],
    notifyEmergency: true
  });

  // System auto-assigns to nearest crew
  // Response time: 35 minutes
  ```

  **Result**: Response time reduced to 35 minutes. All nearby residents informed. Issue resolved in 2 hours instead of 6-8 hours.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Street Light Outage Management">
  **Scenario**: Multiple street lights are out in a neighborhood, creating safety concerns.

  **Problem Context**: Dark streets increase crime risk, traffic accidents, and reduce quality of life. Residents feel unsafe walking at night. Traditional reporting requires multiple phone calls with vague descriptions like "the light near the park."

  **Civiq Solution**:

  Citizens report specific lights using the map interface. Each street light has a unique ID in the system. Electrical department receives batch assignments for efficient routing. Citizens can see all reported outages in their area.

  ```javascript
  // Batch report multiple street lights
  const outageReport = await client.issues.createBatch([
    {
      type: 'streetlight_outage',
      assetId: 'LIGHT_4521',
      location: { lat: 40.7580, lng: -73.9855 },
      reportedBy: 'citizen_789'
    },
    {
      type: 'streetlight_outage',
      assetId: 'LIGHT_4522',
      location: { lat: 40.7581, lng: -73.9856 },
      reportedBy: 'citizen_789'
    }
  ]);

  // System creates optimized route for repair crew
  const route = await client.routes.optimize({
    issues: outageReport.ids,
    crewId: 'crew_electric_01'
  });
  ```

  **Impact**: Electrical crews fix 12 lights in one trip instead of making separate visits. Repair time reduced from 2 weeks to 2 days. Neighborhood safety restored quickly.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Pothole Repair Coordination">
  **Scenario**: Heavy winter causes hundreds of potholes across the city.

  **Challenge**: Road maintenance teams are overwhelmed. No clear prioritization system. Residents complain on social media. City council receives pressure to act. Limited budget requires strategic repair scheduling.

  **Civiq's Approach**:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Citizen Reporting">
      ```javascript
      // Citizens report potholes with severity
      const pothole = await client.issues.create({
        type: 'pothole',
        severity: 'medium',
        location: { address: '5th Avenue & 42nd Street' },
        size: 'large', // small, medium, large
        depth: 'deep', // shallow, moderate, deep
        vehicleDamage: false,
        photos: ['photo1.jpg', 'photo2.jpg']
      });
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Admin Prioritization">
      ```javascript
      // Administrators prioritize based on multiple factors
      const priorityList = await client.issues.prioritize({
        type: 'pothole',
        criteria: {
          trafficVolume: 'high', // High traffic roads first
          damageReports: true, // Vehicle damage reported
          publicTransit: true, // Near bus routes
          schoolZones: true // School safety zones
        }
      });

      // Generate repair schedule
      const schedule = await client.schedules.create({
        issues: priorityList.ids,
        budget: 150000,
        crews: ['crew_road_01', 'crew_road_02'],
        startDate: '2026-02-20'
      });
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Public Transparency">
      ```javascript
      // Publish public repair schedule
      await client.public.publishSchedule({
        scheduleId: schedule.id,
        includeMap: true,
        includeTimeline: true,
        allowComments: true
      });

      // Citizens can view when their street will be repaired
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  **Outcome**: City repairs 450 potholes in 3 weeks. High-traffic areas completed first. Public dashboard shows progress, reducing complaints by 70%. Budget tracked in real-time to prevent overruns.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Power Outage Communication">
  **Scenario**: Severe storm causes widespread power outages affecting 5,000 households.

  **Critical Factors**:

  * Elderly residents need information about warming centers
  * Hospitals and critical facilities need priority restoration
  * Residents flood 311 with calls asking for ETAs
  * Electric crews are overwhelmed and can't answer calls
  * Social media spreads misinformation about restoration times

  **Civiq Emergency Response System**:

  ```javascript
  // Create mass outage event
  const outageEvent = await client.events.create({
    type: 'power_outage',
    severity: 'critical',
    affectedArea: {
      polygon: [[40.7128, -74.0060], ...], // Boundary coordinates
      estimatedHouseholds: 5000
    },
    cause: 'storm_damage',
    estimatedRestoration: '2026-02-16T18:00:00Z'
  });

  // Auto-notify all affected residents
  await client.notifications.sendMass({
    eventId: outageEvent.id,
    channels: ['sms', 'email', 'push'],
    message: 'Power outage confirmed. Crews dispatched. Estimated restoration: 6 PM. Updates every 2 hours.',
    includeWarmingCenters: true,
    includeEmergencyContacts: true
  });

  // Prioritize critical facilities
  await client.facilities.markPriority({
    types: ['hospital', 'nursing_home', 'fire_station'],
    affectedByEvent: outageEvent.id
  });

  // Send periodic updates
  await client.notifications.scheduleUpdates({
    eventId: outageEvent.id,
    interval: '2_hours',
    untilResolved: true
  });
  ```

  **Results**:

  * 4,800 residents receive instant SMS notifications

<Expandable title="Cross-Department Coordination">
  **Scenario**: A sinkhole opens on Main Street, requiring water, streets, and utility departments to coordinate.

  **Complexity Factors**:

  * Water main needs emergency shutoff
  * Street closure requires traffic rerouting
  * Underground utility lines must be inspected
  * Multiple contractors needed for specialized work
  * Public needs constant updates about street closure
  * Local businesses affected by reduced foot traffic

  **Civiq Coordination Workflow**:

  ```javascript
  // Create complex multi-department issue
  const sinkhole = await client.issues.create({
    type: 'infrastructure_failure',
    subtype: 'sinkhole',
    severity: 'critical',
    requiresDepartments: [

        action: 'setup_detour',
        priority: 1,
        estimatedHours: 1
      }
    ]
  });

  // Track dependencies between tasks
  await client.tasks.setDependencies({
    taskId: tasks[2].id, // Utility inspection
    dependsOn: [tasks[0].id], // Wait for water shutoff
    notifyOnComplete: true
  });

  // Publish public status page
  await client.public.createStatusPage({
    issueId: sinkhole.id,
    updates: 'real_time',

## Advanced Workflows

<Expandable title="Automated Issue Assignment">
  Civiq automatically assigns issues to available employees based on their department, workload, and location proximity.

  ```javascript
  // Enable auto-assignment for water department
  await client.settings.update({
    autoAssignment: {
      enabled: true,
      departments: ['water_services'],
      criteria: {
        proximity: true,
        workload: true,
        availability: true
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  When a citizen reports a water issue, the system automatically categorizes the issue type, determines severity level, finds nearby available employees, assigns to the best match, and sends notification to assigned employee.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Real-time Notifications">
  Send instant notifications to users when issue status changes or new assignments are made.

  ```javascript
  // Subscribe to issue updates
  client.notifications.subscribe({
    userId: 'user_12345',
    events: ['issue_created', 'issue_assigned', 'issue_resolved'],
    channels: ['email', 'sms', 'push']
  });
  ```

  Supported notification channels include email notifications, SMS text messages, push notifications (mobile app), in-app alerts, and webhook integrations.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Analytics and Reporting">
  Generate detailed reports on issue resolution times, employee performance, and problem trends.

  ```javascript
  // Get analytics for last 30 days
  const analytics = await client.analytics.get({
    startDate: '2026-01-15',
    endDate: '2026-02-15',
    metrics: ['resolution_time', 'issue_volume', 'employee_performance']
  });

  console.log('Average resolution time:', analytics.avgResolutionTime);
  console.log('Total issues:', analytics.totalIssues);
  console.log('Top performing employee:', analytics.topEmployee);
  ```

  Key metrics tracked: average resolution time by issue type, issue volume trends, employee performance ratings, geographic hotspots, and citizen satisfaction scores.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Integration Options">
  Connect Civiq with your existing systems using webhooks, REST API, or SDKs.

  **Webhook Example:**

  ```javascript
  // Configure webhook for issue events
  await client.webhooks.create({
    url: 'https://your-system.com/webhook',
    events: ['issue.created', 'issue.resolved'],
    secret: 'your_webhook_secret'
  });
  ```

  Integration capabilities include GIS mapping systems, ERP platforms, CRM software, mobile applications, 311 service systems, and payment gateways.
