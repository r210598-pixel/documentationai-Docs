description: Spin up the CreditCardGuard dashboard, Node API, and Python ML risk service locally.
---

## Overview

CreditCardGuard is a MERN dashboard with a separate Python ML inference service for real‑time credit card fraud risk scoring. Use this quickstart to get a local end‑to‑end demo running: web UI → Node API → ML service → risk score.

<Callout kind="info">

This guide assumes you are working from a cloned CreditCardGuard repository. Adjust paths and commands to match your local setup.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- Python 3 (with `venv` available)
- MongoDB (local instance or managed cluster)
- Git (to clone and manage the repo)
- Optional: Docker and Docker Compose if you prefer containers

You should also have a basic understanding of:

- REST APIs (for the Node backend)
- JSON payloads (for ML inference requests)
- Environment variables for secrets and configuration

## Suggested repository structure

A common layout for CreditCardGuard is:

```bash
creditcardguard/
  web/               # React (MERN) dashboard
  api/               # Node.js / Express API layer
  ml-service/        # Python ML inference service (REST or gRPC wrapper)
  docs/              # Documentation (optional, if stored in-repo)
  scripts/           # Helper scripts (optional)
```

You can adapt folder names, but keep:

- The **web** app separate from the **Node API**.
- The **Python ML service** isolated with its own dependencies and virtual environment.

## 1. Configure environment variables

At minimum, you will need environment files for:

- Web dashboard (frontend)
- Node API
- ML service

Common variable sets:

```bash
# web/.env (example)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000

# api/.env (example)
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/creditcardguard
PORT=4000
ML_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5000

# ml-service/.env (example)
MODEL_PATH=./models/fraud_model.pkl
SERVICE_PORT=5000
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

<Callout kind="tip">

Use `.env.local` variants for secrets in development and never commit real card data, API keys, or customer identifiers to source control.

</Callout>

## 2. Run CreditCardGuard locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies" icon="download" titleType="p">

    From the repo root, install dependencies for each service.

    ```bash
    # Web dashboard
    cd web
    npm install

    # Node API
    cd ../api
    npm install

    # Python ML service
    cd ../ml-service
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start MongoDB" icon="database" titleType="p">

    Ensure MongoDB is running locally or that you have a reachable connection string.

    ```bash
    # Example: local MongoDB (adjust for your OS/setup)
    mongod --dbpath /data/db
    ```

    If you use a managed service (for example, MongoDB Atlas), update `MONGO_URI` accordingly in `api/.env`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the ML inference service" icon="terminal" titleType="p">

    In `ml-service`, start the Python server that exposes the fraud model.

    ```bash
    cd ml-service
    source .venv/bin/activate      # Ensure the venv is active
    python app.py                  # Or your preferred entrypoint
    ```

    By default, target `http://localhost:5000` from the Node API (or whatever you set in `ML_SERVICE_URL`).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Node API" icon="code" titleType="p">

    In `api`, start the backend server.

    ```bash
    cd api
    npm run dev    # or: node server.js
    ```

    Confirm it listens on the port defined by `PORT` (for example, `http://localhost:4000`).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the web dashboard" icon="monitor" titleType="p">

    In `web`, start the React app.

    ```bash
    cd web
    npm run dev    # or: npm start
    ```

    Open the printed URL in your browser (for example, `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`) and make sure the dashboard can reach the API.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify with a sample request" icon="check-circle" titleType="p">

    Use `curl` or a REST client to confirm the API can talk to the ML service.

    ```bash
    # Example: POST a sample transaction to the Node API
    curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/transactions/evaluate \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "transactionId": "test-123",
        "amount": 42.50,
        "currency": "USD",
        "merchantCategory": "ecommerce",
        "cardCountry": "US",
        "channel": "online"
      }'
    ```

    You should receive a JSON response with a risk score and classification (for example, `low`, `medium`, `high` risk).

  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Run an end-to-end fraud risk demo

Once all services are running:

1. Open the **CreditCardGuard dashboard** in your browser.
2. Navigate to the **New transaction** or **Test transaction** screen (depending on your UI).
3. Enter a synthetic card transaction (test data only, see security note below).
4. Submit the transaction and wait for the response.
5. Observe:
   - The **risk score** returned from the Python ML service.
   - The **classification** (for example, flagged vs. approved).
   - Any **alert** or log entry created in the dashboard (for example, a row in a transaction table, a notification badge, or a risk alert feed).

To debug issues:

- Check browser dev tools for failed API calls.
- Inspect Node API logs to confirm it is calling the ML service.
- Inspect ML service logs to see incoming features and inference times.

## Security and data handling

<Callout kind="alert">

Never use real cardholder data in development. Always use synthetic or tokenized test data.

</Callout>

Recommended practices for CreditCardGuard:

- **Tokenization only:** Store and process **tokens**, not raw PANs or CVVs. The system should treat any card number field as a tokenized identifier provided by an external PCI‑compliant vault.
- **No PAN/CVV persistence:** Do not log or store full PAN, CVV, or track data in:
  - Application logs
  - Databases
  - Analytics events
- **Masking in UI:** Mask all card‑like identifiers in the dashboard (for example, show only last 4 digits or a hash).
- **Environment separation:** Use separate API keys, database instances, and ML models per environment (dev, staging, prod).

For production rollout, integrate CreditCardGuard with your existing tokenization provider and ensure the Node API only ever receives non‑sensitive tokens and derived features.
