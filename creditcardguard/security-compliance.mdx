# CreditCardGuard - ML Fraud Detection

Build a robust fraud detection and validation system that leverages machine learning models to analyze credit card transaction patterns in real-time, integrated with a user-friendly web dashboard for monitoring and alerts. This project combines MERN stack development with AI/ML to handle thousands of transactions daily, featuring anomaly detection via graph neural networks and control flow analysis for transaction paths.

## Project Overview

The "CreditCardGuard" platform processes credit card details (via secure tokenization) to detect fraud, validate cards, and generate risk scores using ML algorithms trained on synthetic/historical datasets. Users (banks, merchants) upload transaction logs or connect APIs, view interactive dashboards, and receive instant alerts on suspicious activities.

Built on MERN for the web app with a Python ML backend for model inference, this project is ideal for BTech final-year projects—expect 4-6 months development with modular scalability to enterprise levels.

## Core Features

### Real-Time Fraud Detection

ML models (e.g., Isolation Forest, LSTM for sequences) flag anomalies like unusual spending velocity or geolocation jumps.

### Card Validation Engine

Checks BIN/IIN ranges, CVV/Luhn algorithm, and expiry via integrated APIs (e.g., Stripe-like validators).

### Transaction Graph Analysis

Builds control flow graphs of user spending patterns; uses alpha-beta pruning-inspired optimization to prioritize high-risk paths.

### Interactive Web Dashboard

React-based UI with real-time charts, heatmaps of fraud hotspots, and customizable alerts (email/SMS via Twilio).

### Batch Processing & Reporting

Upload CSV/JSON files for bulk analysis; export PDF reports with visualizations.

### Security & Compliance

End-to-end encryption, GDPR-compliant data handling, role-based access (admin/merchant/user).

## Technical Architecture

The system divides into frontend, backend, ML services, and database layers for seamless integration.

| Layer         | Components                                    | Key Tech                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**  | Responsive UI, live updates                   | React, Redux, Socket.io, Chart.js/D3.js                           |
| **Backend**   | API server, auth, orchestration               | Node.js/Express, JWT/OAuth, RabbitMQ for queues                   |
| **ML Engine** | Model training/inference, feature engineering | Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras), NetworkX for graphs      |
| **Database**  | Transactions, user data, model artifacts      | MongoDB (time-series), Redis (caching), MinIO (file storage)      |
| **DevOps**    | Containerization, CI/CD, monitoring           | Docker, Kubernetes (optional), GitHub Actions, Prometheus/Grafana |

**Data flow:** Web form/API → Preprocessing (normalize amount/location) → ML scoring → Dashboard update/alert.

## ML Model Details

Focus on hybrid models for high accuracy (aim for 95+ percent F1-score on Kaggle fraud datasets).

### Feature Engineering

Extract 50+ features including:

* Transaction amount z-score
* Time-of-day entropy
* Merchant category velocity
* IP geolocation velocity
* Graph-based metrics (e.g., PageRank of connected fraud rings)

### Primary Models

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Supervised Learning">
    **XGBoost/Random Forest** on labeled data (fraud/non-fraud) for classification with high precision.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Unsupervised Learning">
    **Autoencoders** for anomaly detection; **GraphSAGE** for relational patterns in transaction networks.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Sequential Analysis">
    **LSTM/GRU** to capture time-series behaviors (e.g., rapid small transactions indicating card testing).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Training Pipeline

Use Python scripts with Pandas/NumPy for data prep; train offline on GPU (Colab free tier), deploy via TensorFlow Serving or Flask API.

### Optimization

Apply alpha-beta pruning analog for beam search in sequence prediction, reducing inference time to less than 50ms per transaction.

### Evaluation

Track ROC-AUC, precision-recall curves; retrain weekly with new data via automated scripts.

### Sample Implementation

```python
import joblib
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained model
model = joblib.load('fraud_model.pkl')

# Extract features from transaction
features = [[amt, vel, geo_dist]]  # [amount, velocity, geo_distance]

# Get fraud probability (risk score)
risk_score = model.predict_proba(features)[0][1]

# Flag if high risk
if risk_score > 0.7:
    trigger_alert(transaction_id, risk_score)
```

## Web Implementation Guide

Leverage the MERN stack for a polished, responsive application.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
npx create-react-app creditguard-ui
cd creditguard-ui
npm install axios recharts tailwindcss socket.io-client
```

Add Tailwind for styling, Axios for API calls, Recharts for graphs.

### Backend APIs

| Endpoint              | Method | Description                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| `/api/transactions`   | POST   | Submit transaction for scoring |
| `/api/dashboard`      | GET    | Fetch real-time metrics/charts |
| `/api/alerts`         | GET    | List user alerts               |
| `/api/bulk-upload`    | POST   | Process CSV files              |
| `/api/models/retrain` | POST   | Trigger model update (admin)   |

### Real-Time Features

Implement Socket.io for live transaction feeds; WebSockets push fraud alerts instantly to connected clients.

```javascript
// Backend - emit fraud alert
io.emit('fraudAlert', {
  transactionId: txn.id,
  riskScore: score,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Frontend - listen for alerts
socket.on('fraudAlert', (alert) => {
  showNotification(alert);
  updateDashboard(alert);
});
```

### Security Implementation

<Callout icon="shield-alt" theme="warning">
  Never store raw card numbers. Hash sensitive data, enforce HTTPS, and implement rate-limiting with express-rate-limit.
</Callout>

### Deployment Options

* **Local Development:** Docker-compose for all services
* **Production:** Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Heroku/Railway (backend), MongoDB Atlas (database)

## Dataset & Training Resources

### Public Datasets

* **Kaggle IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection:** 300k+ transaction samples with labels
* **PaySim:** Synthetic mobile money transactions dataset

### Synthetic Data Generation

Use Faker.js (Node.js) or Python Faker for mock data; augment with SMOTE for class imbalance.

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Load Data:** Import CSV → Handle missing values (impute median for numerical, mode for categorical)
2. **Encode Features:** One-hot encoding for categoricals, embeddings for high-cardinality features
3. **Scale Values:** Apply StandardScaler to numerical features
4. **Split Dataset:** 80/20 train/test split; use cross-validation for robust evaluation

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Preprocess pipeline
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    features, labels, test_size=0.2, stratify=labels
)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
