## Quick Start: Report an Issue

Here's how to report a civic issue using the Civiq API. This example creates a water supply problem report.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const Civiq = require('civiq-sdk');

    // Initialize the client with your API key
    const client = new Civiq({
      apiKey: 'your_api_key_here'
    });

    // Report a water supply issue
    async function reportIssue() {
      try {
        const issue = await client.issues.create({
          type: 'water',
          severity: 'high',
          location: {
            address: '123 Main Street',
            latitude: 40.7128,
            longitude: -74.0060
          },
          description: 'Water main break causing street flooding',
          reportedBy: 'user_12345'
        });
        
        console.log('Issue created:', issue.id);
        console.log('Status:', issue.status);

## Core Features

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Issue Management">
    Track and resolve civic problems efficiently with automated workflows, priority assignment, and real-time status updates. Create and categorize issues, assign to employees or departments, track resolution progress, and generate analytics reports.
  </Card>

  <Card title="User Roles">
    Civiq supports three user types with distinct permissions and capabilities for optimal municipal management. **Citizens** report issues and track status, **Employees** resolve assigned problems, and **Admins** manage users and system settings.
  </Card>

</Columns>

<br />

## Managing Users

Create and manage users across  different roles to build your municipal team.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Create Citizen">
    ```javascript
    const citizen = await client.users.create({
      role: 'citizen',
      email: 'resident@example.com',
      name: 'John Doe',
      phone: '+1234567890',
      address: '456 Oak Avenue'
    });

    console.log('Citizen ID:', citizen.id);
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Create Employee">
    ```javascript
    const employee = await client.users.create({
      role: 'employee',
      email: 'worker@city.gov',
      name: 'Jane Smith',
      department: 'water_services',
      permissions: ['resolve_issues', 'update_status']
    });

    console.log('Employee ID:', employee.id);

## Advanced Workflows

<Expandable title="Automated Issue Assignment">
  Civiq automatically assigns issues to available employees based on their department, workload, and location proximity.

  ```javascript
  // Enable auto-assignment for water department
  await client.settings.update({
    autoAssignment: {
      enabled: true,
      departments: ['water_services'],
      criteria: {
        proximity: true,
        workload: true,
        availability: true
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  When a citizen reports a water issue, the system automatically categorizes the issue type, determines severity level, finds nearby available employees, assigns to the best match, and sends notification to assigned employee.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Real-time Notifications">
  Send instant notifications to users when issue status changes or new assignments are made.

  ```javascript
  // Subscribe to issue updates
  client.notifications.subscribe({
    userId: 'user_12345',
    events: ['issue_created', 'issue_assigned', 'issue_resolved'],
    channels: ['email', 'sms', 'push']
  });
  ```

  Supported notification channels include email notifications, SMS text messages, push notifications (mobile app), in-app alerts, and webhook integrations.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Analytics and Reporting">
  Generate detailed reports on issue resolution times, employee performance, and problem trends.

  ```javascript
  // Get analytics for last 30 days
  const analytics = await client.analytics.get({
    startDate: '2026-01-15',
    endDate: '2026-02-15',
    metrics: ['resolution_time', 'issue_volume', 'employee_performance']
  });

  console.log('Average resolution time:', analytics.avgResolutionTime);
  console.log('Total issues:', analytics.totalIssues);
  console.log('Top performing employee:', analytics.topEmployee);
  ```

  Key metrics tracked: average resolution time by issue type, issue volume trends, employee performance ratings, geographic hotspots, and citizen satisfaction scores.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Integration Options">
  Connect Civiq with your existing systems using webhooks, REST API, or SDKs.

  **Webhook Example:**

  ```javascript
  // Configure webhook for issue events
  await client.webhooks.create({
    url: 'https://your-system.com/webhook',
    events: ['issue.created', 'issue.resolved'],
    secret: 'your_webhook_secret'
  });
  ```

  Integration capabilities include GIS mapping systems, ERP platforms, CRM software, mobile applications, 311 service systems, and payment gateways.

## Authentication

Authenticate your API requests using API keys. Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code.

<Callout kind="alert">
  Your API key carries many privileges. Keep it secure and never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
</Callout>

```javascript
// Authentication example
const Civiq = require('civiq-sdk');

const client = new Civiq({
  apiKey: process.env.CIVIQ_API_KEY, // Use environment variables
  environment: 'production' // or 'sandbox' for testing
});
```
