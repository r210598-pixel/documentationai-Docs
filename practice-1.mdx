# CreditCardGuard - ML Fraud Detection

Credit card fraud detection system using machine learning and MERN stack for real-time transaction analysis.

## Project Overview

The **"CreditCardGuard"** platform processes tokenized credit card details to detect fraud, validate cards, and generate risk scores using ML algorithms trained on synthetic/historical datasets. Users (banks, merchants) upload transaction logs or connect APIs, view interactive dashboards, and receive instant alerts on suspicious activities.

**MERN web app + Python ML backend** - ideal for BTech final-year projects (4-6 months).

## Core Features

### 🔍 Real-Time Fraud Detection
ML models (Isolation Forest, LSTM) flag anomalies like unusual spending velocity or geolocation jumps.

### 🏦 Card Validation Engine
BIN/IIN ranges, CVV/Luhn algorithm, expiry validation via APIs.

### 📊 Transaction Graph Analysis
Control flow graphs + alpha-beta pruning optimization for high-risk paths.

### 📈 Interactive Dashboard
React UI with real-time charts, fraud heatmaps, Twilio alerts.

## Technical Architecture

| Layer | Components | Key Tech |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Frontend** | Responsive UI, live updates | React, Redux, Socket.io, Chart.js |
| **Backend** | API server, auth | Node.js/Express, JWT, RabbitMQ |
| **ML Engine** | Model training/inference | Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), NetworkX |
| **Database** | Transactions, models | MongoDB, Redis, MinIO |
| **DevOps** | Containerization, monitoring | Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions |

**Data flow:** Form/API → Preprocessing → ML scoring → Dashboard/alert.

### Sample Implementation

```python
import joblib
import numpy as np

model = joblib.load('fraud_model.pkl')
features = [[amt, vel, geo_dist]]  # [amount, velocity, geo_distance]
risk_score = model.predict_proba(features)

if risk_score > 0.7:
    trigger_alert(transaction_id, risk_score)
