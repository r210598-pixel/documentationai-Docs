## What is CreditCardGuard?

CreditCardGuard is a credit card validation and fraud detection system combining rule-based checks, machine learning models, and a web dashboard for monitoring and investigation.

It validates incoming card transactions, scores their fraud risk in real time, and routes high-risk activity to analysts with clear alerts and case context. The system is designed as a final-year BTech project but follows patterns that real banks and payment processors use in production.

## Who is CreditCardGuard for?

CreditCardGuard is designed around three primary user groups, each with distinct responsibilities and dashboard views.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Bank operations team" href="#bank-operations-dashboard" icon="shield" horizontal="false">
    For issuing banks or payment processors that need to monitor and control card transaction risk at scale.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Merchants / PSPs" href="#merchant-dashboard" icon="terminal" horizontal="false">
    For merchants or payment service providers that want to reduce chargebacks and detect suspicious purchase patterns.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Fraud analysts" href="#fraud-analyst-dashboard" icon="bar-chart" horizontal="false">
    For analysts who investigate alerts, review model decisions, and tune rules or thresholds.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Bank operations dashboard

The bank operations view focuses on portfolio-level risk and operational control.

- Monitor aggregated fraud risk across all transactions in near real time.
- Configure global thresholds for blocking, challenging, or allowing transactions.
- View high-risk cards, devices, and IP ranges.
- Export activity summaries for compliance and reporting.

### Merchant dashboard

The merchant or payment service provider (PSP) view focuses on transaction quality and chargeback reduction.

- See recent transactions and their validation or fraud score outcomes.
- Identify risky customers, devices, or locations for a specific merchant account.
- Track the impact of rules or ML thresholds on approval and decline rates.
- Receive alerts for abnormal spikes in fraud scores or declines.

### Fraud analyst dashboard

The fraud analyst view is optimized for investigation and model understanding.

- Inspect detailed transaction timelines and risk scores.
- Drill into graph-based relationships between cards, devices, IPs, and merchants.
- Review explanations for model decisions and rule hits.
- Mark transactions as fraudulent or legitimate to generate labels for retraining.

## Key capabilities

CreditCardGuard combines multiple capabilities to detect and manage fraud efficiently.

### Real-time validation and scoring

- Validate basic card details using checksum logic and format constraints.
- Enforce configurable business rules (such as velocity limits and country restrictions).
- Compute real-time fraud scores using a trained machine learning model.
- Classify transactions into risk bands (for example, allow, challenge, block) based on thresholds.

### Graph-based relationship analysis

- Build simple link graphs between cards, devices, IP addresses, and merchants.
- Surface suspicious clusters, such as many cards used from one device or IP.
- Highlight shared attributes between confirmed fraud cases to support investigations.

### Alerting and case management

- Generate alerts for transactions above configurable risk thresholds.
- Group related high-risk events into cases for analyst review.
- Track alert lifecycle from created to under review to resolved.
- Capture analyst feedback that can be used as labels for model improvement.

### Data safety and privacy model

CreditCardGuard is designed as a learning project but still applies basic data-safety practices:

- Use tokenization for primary account numbers (PAN) so that dashboards and logs only see tokens, not raw card numbers.
- Never store full PAN or CVV values in the application database.
- Retain only the minimum metadata needed for analytics (such as hashed identifiers and aggregated statistics).

<Callout kind="tip">

Keep the data model and storage layer free of raw cardholder data. Use synthetic or anonymized datasets during development and testing to avoid handling real payment information.
